// This was another challenge that I found difficult, as it uses multiple functions. I had to research
// which functions would be needed and how to write the code properly.
// I learned how to write higher order arrow functions and that they were: map(), filter(), and reduce().
// I used filter() in this exercise. 

const realNumberArray = [4, 5.6, -9.8, 3.14, 42, 6, 8.34, -2];
const squareList = (arr) => {
  "use strict";
  // change code below this line
  const squaredIntegers = arr.filter( (num) => num > 0 && num % parseInt(num) === 0 ).map( (num) => Math.pow(num, 2) );
  // change code above this line
  return squaredIntegers;
};
// test your code
const squaredIntegers = squareList(realNumberArray);
console.log(squaredIntegers);
