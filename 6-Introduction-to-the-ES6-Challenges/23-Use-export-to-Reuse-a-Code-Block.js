// In this exercise, I added export before the const variables. This lesson teaches how to use
// export to reuse a code block. The examples were a little more complex than the exercise.
// I learned that export is a non-browser feature. Export is used when you want to use that
// file in another file, where you must import it.

export const foo = "bar";
export const bar = "foo";
