// This exercises is practive in comparing different values. It goes over what was learned in the previous two
// exercises. The exercise was simple and I only had to change == to ===.

// Setup
function compareEquality(a, b) {
  if (a === b) { // Change this line
    return "Equal";
  }
  return "Not Equal";
}

// Change this value to test
compareEquality(10, "10");
