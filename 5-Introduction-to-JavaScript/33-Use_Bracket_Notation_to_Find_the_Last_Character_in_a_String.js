// The example helps you format the code properly. I learned how to use bracket notation to
// find the last character in a string. First you find the length using .length and then subtract 1.
// When the code runs, it finds the length of the string and then subtracts 1 from index 0. Since
// index 0 has the character L subtracting 1 reverses you back through the string to the last index.

// Example
var firstName = "Ada";
var lastLetterOfFirstName = firstName[firstName.length - 1];

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.
var lastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length - 1];
