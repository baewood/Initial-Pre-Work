// This exercise expands on the previous lesson. I learned how to concatenate using the += operator.
// I also learned that it is important to watch out for spaces because concatenation doesn't add spaces between strings. 

// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. ";
ourStr += "I come second.";

// Only change code below this line

var myStr = "This is the first sentence. ";
myStr += "This is the second sentence.";
