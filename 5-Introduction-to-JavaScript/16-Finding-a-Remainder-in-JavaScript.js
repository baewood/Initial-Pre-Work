// In this lesson, I learned how to find a remainder in JavaScript using the remainder
// operator %. I also learned that the remainder operator is sometimes referred to as the
// "modulus" operator and that this is incorrect. It doesn't work properly with negative numbers.

var remainder = 11 % 3; // The value is 2.
