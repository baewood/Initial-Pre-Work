// This was a practice in understanding case sensitivity in variables.
// I learned that declarations and assignments needed to match in case.
// I also learned what camelCase was and how it was the proper way in JS to name variables. 

// Declarations
var studlyCapVar;
var properCamelCase;
var titleCaseOver;

// Assignments
studlyCapVar = 10;
properCamelCase = "A String";
titleCaseOver = 9000;
