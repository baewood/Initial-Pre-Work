// I learned how to put double quotes inside of a string using double quotes.
// I also learned that in JS, you can escape a quote from considering it as an end of a
// string by using the backslash in front of the quote. It signals that it's not the end
// of the string but that it should be inside of the string. 

var myStr = "I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes\".";
