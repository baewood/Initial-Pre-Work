// In this lesson, I learned how to build JavaScript objects. I also learned that objects are similar to
// arrays, except it uses properties instead of indexes to access and modify data. 

// Example
var ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};

// Only change code below this line.

var myDog = {
  "name": "Baby",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["Me and you!"]



};
