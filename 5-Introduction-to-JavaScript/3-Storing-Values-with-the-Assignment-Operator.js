// In this lesson, I learned how to store values with an assinment operator.
// I also learned that assignment goes from right to left, so everything to the right
// of the operator is resolved before the value is assigned. 

// Setup
var a;
var b = 2;

// Only change code below this line
var a = 7;
var b = a;
