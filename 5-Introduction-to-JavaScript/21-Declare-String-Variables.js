// This lesson shows you how to declare string variables. It's called a string literal.
// I learned it is a string because it is enclosed in single or double quotes.

// Example
var firstName = "Alan";
var lastName = "Turing";

// Only change code below this line

var myFirstName = "Brittany";
var myLastName = "Wood";
