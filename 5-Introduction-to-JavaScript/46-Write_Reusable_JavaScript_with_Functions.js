// I learned how to write reusable functions with JavaScript. Through previous coding experience,
// I'm already familiar with how functions work. JS functions are written similarly to how C++ functions
// are written. I learned that what's inside conole.log is what is seen, but only in the dev console.

// Example
function ourReusableFunction() {
  console.log("Heyya, World");
}

ourReusableFunction();

// Only change code below this line
function reusableFunction() {
  console.log("Hi World");
}

reusableFunction();
