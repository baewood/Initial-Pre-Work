// I learned how to construct string with variables. It was a familiar concept so,
// this exercise reaffirmed what I previously learned. 

// Example
var ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";

// Only change code below this line
var myName = "Brittany";
var myStr = "Hello, my name is " + myName + ", what's up?";
