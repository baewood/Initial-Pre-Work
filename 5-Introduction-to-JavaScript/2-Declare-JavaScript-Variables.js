// In this lesson, I learned how to declare variables. To declare a variable in JS,
// you need to put the keyword var in front of it. I also learned that variable names
// can be made up of numbers, letters and $ or _, but can't contain spaces or start with a number.

// Example
var ourName;

// Declare myName below this line
var myName;
