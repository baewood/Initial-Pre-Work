// I learned that writing for loops has the same information as a while loop, but it is written on one line.
// First is the initialization, then the condition and then the final expression.

// Example
var ourArray = [];

for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  ourArray.push(i);
}

// Setup
var myArray = [];

// Only change code below this line.
for ( var i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  myArray.push(i);
}
