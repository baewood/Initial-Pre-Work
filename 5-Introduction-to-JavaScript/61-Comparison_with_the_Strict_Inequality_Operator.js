// This lesson goes along with what was learned in previous lessons with comparison.
// In this exercise, I learned about the strict inequality operator !==. It will not convert data types.

// Setup
function testStrictNotEqual(val) {
  // Only Change Code Below this Line

  if (val !== 17) {

  // Only Change Code Above this Line

    return "Not Equal";
  }
  return "Equal";
}

// Change this value to test
testStrictNotEqual(10);
