/* In this lesson, I learned that when JS variables are declared
they have an initial value of undefined. Initializing variables avoids getting
the string "undefined" and the result of NaN which means "not a number." */

// Initialize these three variables
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = "I am a";

// Do not change code below this line

a = a + 1;
b = b + 5;
c = c + " String!";
