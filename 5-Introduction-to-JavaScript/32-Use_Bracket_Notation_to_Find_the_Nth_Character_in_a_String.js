// Bracket notation was used to get a character at other positions within the string.
// The variable wanted the third letter, and since indexes start at 0, 2 went inside the bracket to
// represent the third letter of the string.

// Example
var firstName = "Ada";
var secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1];

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.
var thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName[2];
