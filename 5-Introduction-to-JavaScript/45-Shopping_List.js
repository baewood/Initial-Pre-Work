// In this lesson, I had to create a shopping list in the given variable. I used what I learned
// in previous exercises to add to the array. Instead of using multiple lines of code, I chose
// to only use the push() function.

var myList = [];
myList.push(["Apples", 4], ["Bananas", 2], ["Beans", 3], ["Chocolates", 4], ["Milk",1]);
