// In this lesson, I learned how to compound assignments with augmented addition.
// To me, it's shorthand code. var a's outcome needed to be 15 so instead of writing
// a = 3 + 12, var a is initialized and then compounded as a += 12 to equal 15. 

var a = 3;
var b = 17;
var c = 12;

// Only modify code below this line

a += 12;
b += 9;
c += 7;
