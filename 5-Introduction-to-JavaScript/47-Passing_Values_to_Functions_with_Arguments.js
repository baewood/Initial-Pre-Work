// I learned how to pass values to functions with arguments. The exercise explains the difference
// between parameters and arguments. Arguments are the values that are passed into the function when it's called.
// The arguements in functionWithArgs were assigned to variables. 1 to a and 2 to b.

// Example
function ourFunctionWithArgs(a, b) {
  console.log(a - b);
}
ourFunctionWithArgs(10, 5); // Outputs 5

// Only change code below this line.
function functionWithArgs(a, b) {
  console.log(a + b);
}

functionWithArgs(1,2);
