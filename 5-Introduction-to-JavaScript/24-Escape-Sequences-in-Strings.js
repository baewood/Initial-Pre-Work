// In this lesson, I learned more about escape sequences in strings. I also learned that there
// are two reasons to use escaping characters. One is to allow you to use character you might not be
// able to type out, and the other is to allow you to represent multiple quotes in a string without JS
// misinterpreting what you meant. In previous exercises, I learned about: \', \" and \\. From previous,
// coding experience I knew about the newline character, but for me the following code was new: \r, \t, \b, and \f.

var myStr = "FirstLine\n\t\\SecondLine\nThirdLine";
