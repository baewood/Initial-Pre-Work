// In this lesson, I learned how to find the length of a string using .length after the variable.
// .length counts the number of character in the variable it is added to.

// Example
var firstNameLength = 0;
var firstName = "Ada";

firstNameLength = firstName.length;

// Setup
var lastNameLength = 0;
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.

lastNameLength = lastName.length;
