// In this lesson, I learned how to access object properties with dot notation.
// I learned that dot notation is what is used when you know the name of the property you're
// trying to access ahead of time. 

// Setup
var testObj = {
  "hat": "ballcap",
  "shirt": "jersey",
  "shoes": "cleats"
};

// Only change code below this line

var hatValue = testObj.hat;      // Changed this line
var shirtValue = testObj.shirt;    // Changed this line
