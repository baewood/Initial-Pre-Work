// I learned that bracket notation and dot notation are similar when accessing object properties.
// I also learned that if the property of the object has a space in its name, you need to use
// bracket notation. Also, you can still use bracket notation if there are not spaces.

// Setup
var testObj = {
  "an entree": "hamburger",
  "my side": "veggies",
  "the drink": "water"
};

// Only change code below this line

var entreeValue = testObj["an entree"];   // Changed this line
var drinkValue = testObj["the drink"];    // Changed this line
