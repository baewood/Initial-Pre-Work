// This exercise had me removed the outer double quotes, and backslashes. I changed the
// outer double quotes to single quotes. This helped removed the escape characters.
// In this lesson, I learned the differences between what would be considered a good string and a
// bad one in the lesson's examples. I didn't know that you could quote strings with single quotes,
// I thought you could only use one type of quotes throughout the whole string. 

var myStr = '<a href="http://www.example.com" target="_blank">Link</a>';
