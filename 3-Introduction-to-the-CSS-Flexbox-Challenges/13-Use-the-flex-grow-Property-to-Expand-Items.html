<!-- This lesson was about flex-grow, the opposite of flex-shrink. But like flex-shrink,
this property takes numbers as values. The bigger the number, the bigger it will grow.
In this exercise, box two was given the bigger number, so it is larger than box one.-->

<style>
  #box-container {
    display: flex;
    height: 500px;
  }

  /*Changes made to the following IDs*/
  #box-1 {
    background-color: dodgerblue;
    height: 200px;
    flex-grow: 1;
  }

  #box-2 {
    background-color: orangered;
    height: 200px;
    flex-grow: 2;
  }
</style>

<div id="box-container">
  <div id="box-1"></div>
  <div id="box-2"></div>
