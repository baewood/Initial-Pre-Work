<!-- I learned how to override styles in CSS. I created another class called blue-text and added it
to the h1 element along with the pink-text class. Since blue-text is listed first, it is the class that
is prioritized, therefore the text is blue and not pink.-->

<style>
  body {
    background-color: black;
    font-family: monospace;
    color: green;
  }
  .pink-text {
    color: pink;
  }

/*Changes made here*/
  .blue-text {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>
<h1 class=" blue-text pink-text">Hello World!</h1>
