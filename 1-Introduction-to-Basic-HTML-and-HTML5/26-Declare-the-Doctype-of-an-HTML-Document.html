<!-- This lesson is to show us how to declare the doctype of an html document.
This is important because it tells the browser which version of html is being used.
I learned that the ! and DOCTYPE being uppercase is important for older browsers and
that this should be included in every html document.-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <h1>This test is to create a doctype. </h1>
