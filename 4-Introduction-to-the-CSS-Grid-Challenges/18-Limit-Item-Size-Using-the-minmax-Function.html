<!-- In this lesson, I learned how to limit item size using the minmax function. At first
this exercise was really challenging. I tried to mimic the code from the repeat function
exercise and then tried to create the code going off of the example in the lesson. I learned
that the minmax function went inside the repeat function through trial and error. I thought of
it less as CSS but something similar to programming languages instead of scripting where
repeat was the initial function needed and that minmax was the function being called within another
function. I don't think it's something that would actually be done in a language, for example, like
Python, but the idea is what helped me figure out what needed to be done.-->
